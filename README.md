# BBEdit Codeless Language Module for Protocol Buffers

[Codeless language module](http://www.barebones.com/support/develop/clm.html)
for [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/). Works
with [BBEdit](http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/) and
[TextWrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/).

To install, download [protobuf.plist](https://raw.github.com/mihaip/bbedit-protobuf/master/protobuf.plist)
and place it in the `Language Modules` subdirectory:

`~/Library/Application Support/BBEdit/Language Modules` (traditional location)
`~/Dropbox/Application Support/BBEdit/Language Modules` (Dropbox location)

Replace `BBEdit` with `TextWrangler` as needed.
